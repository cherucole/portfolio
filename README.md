# My first independent project

#### By Cheruiyot Collins

## Description
This is my first independent project. The project is about creating a portfolio for all my work done. This will involve using the techniques skills and tricks I have learnt during the course of the week. This was achieved through use of html and css to build a website that showcases my work.
